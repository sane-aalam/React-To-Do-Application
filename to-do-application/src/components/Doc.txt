1.useState - 
useState is a React Hook used in functional components to add state variables to the component.
It provides a way to manage state in functional components, which were previously stateless.
The useState hook returns an array with two elements:
The current value of the state variable.
A function to update the state variable.
It takes the initial state as an argument and returns the current state value and a function to update it.
You can call the state updating function returned by useState to update the state variable and trigger a re-render of the component

The map method is a built-in JavaScript array method used to iterate over an array and create a new array by transforming each element based on a callback function.
